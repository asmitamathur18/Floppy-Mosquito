🦟 Floppy Mosquito

Floppy Mosquito is a browser-based arcade game inspired by classic one-button endless runner games. The player controls a mosquito and navigates through moving obstacles using tap or click inputs.

The game includes a revive mechanic that allows players to continue gameplay after collisions, adding an extra challenge and strategy element.

The project demonstrates core front-end concepts such as animation loops, collision detection, event handling, and game state management using vanilla web technologies.
